build a cross domain search 

search for IP across all CMA
search for name across all CMA
search for a network across all cma (maybe)

then convert to web form.


IP search takes too much time.  doing a login for IP then later a range search in a sep login
is sloooow.   need to combine these into same function with same sid.
